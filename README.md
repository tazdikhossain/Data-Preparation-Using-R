# Data-Preparation-Using-R

This study explores data visualization techniques applied to cirrhosis patient outcomes using the R programming language. It emphasizes how graphical representations, such as histograms, bar graphs, box plots, violin plots, scatter plots, scatter plot matrices, and radar charts, can enhance the understanding of complex medical datasets.

Key Points:

Objective: To improve insights into cirrhosis patient survival rates by using data visualization methods, aiding in decision-making and advancing medical knowledge.

Dataset: Utilizes a dataset from the Mayo Clinic (1974-1984) on primary biliary cirrhosis, provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, including attributes like age, bilirubin, albumin, and status (censored or death).

Techniques:

Univariate Visualization: Histograms for quantitative data distribution, bar graphs for categorical data, and box plots for statistical summary.
Multivariate Visualization: Violin plots to display distribution across categories, scatter plots to reveal relationships between variables, scatter plot matrices for comprehensive attribute interactions, and radar charts for comparing multiple attributes.
Findings: Visualization techniques reveal patterns and correlations in the data, such as the relationships between serum bilirubin levels and age, or copper levels and alkaline phosphatase. These methods facilitate a better understanding of disease progression and patient outcomes.

Conclusion: Data visualization is crucial in simplifying and interpreting complex datasets in medical research, ultimately improving patient care and supporting informed clinical decisions.
